# Change default top-5 disco men count
Just for fun if you would like to write some funny initials or otherwise mark what you have modded in the roms.

The initials are on rom 33
BEA = 0x31b75 (01 04 00)
TAT = 0x31b78 (13 00 13)
TAC = 0x31b7b (13 00 02)
KCA = 0x31b7e (0A 02 00)
VE  = 0x31b81 (15 04 00)

The alphabet starts from 00
A = 00
B = 01
C = 02
D = 03
E = 04
F = 05
G = 06
H = 07
I = 08
J = 09
K = 0A
L = 0B
M = 0C
N = 0D
O = 0E
P = 0F
Q = 10
R = 11
S = 12
T = 13
U = 14
V = 15
W = 16
X = 17
Y = 18 
Z = 19

For some reason the 5th place has only two characters when the third value is 00 (=A) but if you change it to something else it will show.
