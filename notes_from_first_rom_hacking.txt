Documentation of rom hacking


Software
Cygnus hex editor (Windows store app)
- to read and alter rom (bin files)
- Can compare two files to show what has changed (clean vs. modified)

Lunar IPS (zip file download)
- Applying .ips (patch files) on top of rom files
- Creating .ips by comparing modified and clean rom


Example ips file
5041 5443 4800 46ee 0001 7100 47a3 0002
7171 031b 2800 0950 0040 0030 0020 0010
454f 46
 
NOTES
Place calculation starts from 0 so that why the actual place number is always + 1 of the value
